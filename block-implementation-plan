- hash method:
	A map/hash object will be a 2-d array, each position either a 0 or 1. 0
	indicates empty space, 1 indicates a block to be placed at the coordinates
	correspoinding the position in the 2-d array. When the game loads, block
	entities will be created based on their positions in the hash. The hash is
	created from a list of raw strings, raw_hash, that will be processed into a
	proper 2d array. raw_hash will be a list of strings all of equal length,
	and each character will either be a 0 or 1. The originating coordiantes(in
	game coords) will be 0,0.

	hash variables:
	- raw matrix
	- 2d array

	hash methods:
	- createBlocks()

- block
	A square entity implemented the the hash. If applicable, a block will have
	an attribute that represents which quad it will use for it's image. Each
	block will have coorindates that represent the position within the hash.
	These coordinates will be used to determine the coordinates at which the
	block is drawn at.

	block variable members:
	- x y coords(on screen)
	- x y coords(in hash)
	- side length(constant for all blocks)
	- quad code(mayabe)
